/**
 * <p>Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of
 * many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried inside a
 * monstrous constructor with lots of parameters.
 * Or even worse: scattered all over the client code.
 * </p>
 * <p>For example, letâ€™s think about how to create a House object.
 * To build a simple house, you need to construct four walls and a floor,
 * install a door, fit a pair of windows, and build a roof. But what if you want a bigger,
 * brighter house, with a backyard and other goodies
 * (like a heating system, plumbing, and electrical wiring)?
